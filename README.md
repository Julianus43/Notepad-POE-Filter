# Notepad-POE-Filter
A syntax highlight for Path of Exile loot filter.

Just download the file, change the extension from .txt to .xml and then import it into Notepad++.

To import the file to Notepad++ : Open Notepad++ > Language > Define your language... > Import

Note: Change the ".filter" in the Ext box to "filter" (remove the '.') so that the highlight is applied when the filter files are opened with notepad++.

Comments are green text with grey background.
BaseType items are blue italicized text.
Class items are green italisized text.
Condtions / Actions are brown ish.

Some typos and incorrect capitalization of words have a red background.

If a word receives no coloring then the highlighting didn't recognize it.

Enjoy!

Only small problems:

It doesn't highlight "Maelstr√∂m Staff" and assumes "Flask" to be a BaseType even though it can be a Class.
